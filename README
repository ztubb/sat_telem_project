# Telemetry Processing Stack

A test project implementing a minimally viable stack for ingesting telemetry data.

## Design

- The mock data publisher is primarily sourced from the provided python script. It generates telemetry data at a fixed rate of one message/sec and publishes it on request via a UDP connection.
- The data ingestor is written in Go. It initiates a UDP connection and receives data from the mock data publisher. Received data is parsed and stored in a single PostgreSQL table
- Services are containerized and deployed/configured with docker compose.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. To build and run the stack, execute the following command
   - ```docker compose up --build```
